# Background

The Simos18 is a series of ECUs (Engine Control Units) utilized in a broad range of Volkswagen AG vehicles. The ECUs are manufactured by Continental-Siemens and are based on the Infineon Tricore CPU.

An Engine Control Unit accepts stimulus from various sensors attached to an engine, and is responsible for then running the control systems driving the engine itself. Such inputs include one or several cam angle sensors, crankshaft trigger sensors, air pressure sensors, and position actuators for the accelerator pedal, throttle plate, and turbocharger actuators. This document is not intended to explain engine control principles from a base level and assumes the reader is familiar enough with engine control systems to recognize the value in replacing the calibration data used in tuning the ECU's control systems.

# Embedded System Architecture

The Simos18 contains either the Infineon SAK-TC1791S-384 F200EP processor ("Simos18.1") or the SAK-TC1791S-512 F240EP processor ("Simos18.10").

These processors are Tricore processors from the TC179x series. The Tricore architecture is not really a parallel multi-core architecture as the name would suggest. Rather, "the real-time capability of a microcontroller, the computational power of a DSP, and the high performance/price features of a RISC load/store architecture" lead to the "Tricore" name.

Tricore is a moderately complex RISC-like 32-bit architecture. It has hybrid 32-bit and 16-bit instructions. The Tricore parts used in the Simos ECUs look like a "typical microcontroller" in that they support exection directly from memory-mapped program flash (PMEM) and do not have an MMU. The non-MMU models have several memory mapped peripherals including a programmable I/O coprocessor. With no MMU, address space is flat, although a degree of global remapping is possible using an overlay controller.

There are a few interesting protections: memory regions can be marked as non-executable, and the CPU provides hardware RTOS support via hardware store and restoration of "task contexts," which can have their own register state and can be given different permissions to read/write/execute memory. Flash areas and debugger attachment can also be protected by passwords which are stored in a purportedly-inaccessible area of flash and enforced by the CPU itself (although with no security co-processor, the software running on the CPU needs to be able to calculate and apply the password at runtime to unlock itself, so this is a rather weak trust model).

In general, the main protection Tricore possesses is a simple architectural one: the flash memory is physically internal to the processor module, so it cannot be dumped, sniffed, or altered without the permission of the CPU itself. This means the protections inherent in the software are actually much simpler and more exploitable than in other embedded systems, because Flash is generally considered as a "trusted" part of the system architecture.

At any rate, none of these protections actually play a substantial role in this particular exploit process due to a series of lucky breaks, coincedences, and humorous issues.

A few more things about Tricore are helpful: the "nop" instruction is represented by 00 (this is critical later), and full programmer's manual is free and available with no paywall: https://www.infineon.com/dgdl/tc1_6__architecture_vol1.pdf?fileId=db3a3043372d5cc801373b0f374d5d67 . 

# Boot Process and Layout

The Tricore boot process begins with a mask ROM, which initializes the state of several debug co-processors and allows for the loading of a recovery or "Bootstrap Loader" (BSL) over UART or CAN, depending on the state of the HWCFG register. In Simos18, the HWCFG is set to "direct execution" mode, so the mask ROM unlocks Flash for read and execute, and execution begins at 0x80000000/0xA0000000 in PMEM unless HWCFG has been altered.

Continental/Siemens, along with most other vendors using Tricore CPUs for engine control, have chosen to implement their application software in a series of blocks:

0. 0x80000000-0x80014000: SBOOT (Supplier Bootloader). This bootloader is fixed across the delivered control units in a Supplier range (i.e., all Simos ECUs). It is never updated or flashed remotely once the ECU is in service.

    * 0x80014000-0x8001C000: OTP (One Time Programmed), also sometimes referred to as Tuning Protection. This area of PMEM is programmed at "end-of-line" during ECU manufacturing. It contains cryptographic primitives used in SBOOT and CBOOT, the RSA public keys used to verify the firmware, Tricore flash memory passwords, and the Tricore Device ID used to "marry" the software to the ECU. This section begins with an export table for crypto functions at 0x80014000, followed by boot passwords at 0x8001420C. It is protected by the Tricore flash controller's One Time Programming capability and can never be altered.  
1. 0x8001C000-0x80040000: CBOOT (Customer's Bootloader). This bootloader is updated and flashed remotely with each update. It contains the Customer (in this case, VW)'s manufacturer-specified flash memory update and verification routines. During the flashing process, a section of CBOOT is loaded into RAM and executed from there - 0x162FF bytes are copied from 0x80022000 to 0xD0008000.
2. 0x80040000-0x80140000: ASW1 (Application Software 1). These blocks consist of the Application Software. The Application Software for most ECUs is not hand-written compiled C code, but rather generated code from a model built using a tool like Simulink. When you read an article about "millions of lines of code in a control unit," it's worth rolling your eyes and closing it.
3. 0x80140000-0x80880000: ASW2 (Application Software 2)
4. 0x80880000-0x808FFC00: ASW3 (Application Software 3)
5. 0x80800000 / 0xA0800000: CAL (Calibration). This block consists of the vehicle-specific data which drives the generated models compiled into the Application Software. This is where the tables mapping things like airflow mass to fuel requirements, pedal request to torque request, and so on live. They're what changes to make each car model run correctly and meet emissions requirements from the factory, and therefore are what "tuners" seek to change to alter the performance of a vehicle.

# Boot procedure and trust chain

The boot-time process follows the list: Mask ROM -> SBOOT -> CBOOT -> ASW/CAL.

The Mask ROM first checks the state of the HWCFG register to determine whether to jump into a [bootstrap loader](https://github.com/bri3d/TC1791_CAN_BSL) or into PMEM at 0x80000000. In the case that the configuration is set to jump into PMEM, memory is left read-unprotected and executable. If a bootstrap loader is selected, memory is locked for read and execution using the Tricore USR0 password flags, the bootstrap loader is placed in scratchpad ram at 0xC0000000 and subsequently executed from there. So, the USR0 passwords or a method to recover them are necessary to access flash from the bootstrap loader.

If HWCFG is not set to jump to the bootstrap loader, execution is next passed to SBOOT at 0x80000000. The Continental SBOOT [checks for a specific waveform on two ECU pins to enter a command shell](https://github.com/bri3d/Simos18_SBOOT) . If execution is uninterrupted, SBOOT next checks for a "CBOOT_temp" awaiting promotion in flash. If the CBOOT_temp exists, it has its CRC and Valid flags measured and then is promoted into the CBOOT area and the device reset into the new CBOOT. Otherwise, SBOOT continues execution by measuring the "OK" blocks and CRC checksum for CBOOT, then jumping into it.

When CBOOT starts up, it checks a "reboot reason" flag to verify that the system is starting up normally. It then verifies that each individual software block has an "OK Flag" set before jumping in.

These "OK Flags" are outside of the remotely-writeable range of flash - immediately after each software block. They are set as part of the flash-memory update process in CBOOT, after a block has been measured against a [CRC32 checksum](https://github.com/bri3d/VW_Flash/blob/master/lib/checksum.py) and an [RSA signature check](rsa.md). Because flash is "trusted" in this model, SBOOT and CBOOT assume that as long as the OK flag is already present in flash, no additional re-measurement of a block is necessary and it is safe to unlock and jump into the block. If all necessary OK Flags aren't set, CBOOT simply does not continue the boot process, instead waiting in "programming mode" for a manufacturer tool to supply a valid flash to resolve the issue.

Simple enough. This process is quite exploitable if flash can be written, but flash is inside the CPU and locked away, so we still need a way in. 

* The Mask ROM and Bootstrap Loaders are appealing, but the Tricore architecture implements a series of password protections around flash memory read, write, and debug, which have proven to be fairly robust in terms of backdoor access (the passwords, of course, need to be calculatable by the application software and therefore can be discovered, but first one must read flash...). 
* SBOOT is interesting as it must allow for the supplier to install the manufacturer's software in some way or another, but the non-standard communications required aren't compatible with the other control systems in the vehicle and only work with the ECU removed. This part of the system comes in handy for getting a ROM dump of a new ECU, and for extracting the USR0 read/execute passwords without performing a risky reflash-based exploit. [A working exploit chain to extract boot passwords from the SBOOT reprogramming interface is documented here](https://github.com/bri3d/Simos18_SBOOT) .
* The SBOOT exploit requires removing the control module from the vehicle and opening its case, so an exploit which can be performed over the manufacturer's diagnostic system is still useful ("port flashing"). So next, we will look at CBOOT and the manufacturer update process.

# CBOOT and Port Flashing

CBOOT is supplied by VW and therefore follows a VW Group standard for flash-memory updates. This standard is based on a wide variety of massively overcomplicated international standards such as ASAM ODX. The VW manufacturer diagnostics tool, called ODIS, loads encrypted ODX XML files from a manufacturer [ZIP-and-encrypt container called FRF](../frf), reads a standardized re-flash procedure documented in another set of ODX XML files (called Diagnostic ODX), and performs the flash routine. 

This means that with both a Flash ODX and Diagnostic ODX, the flash routine is an open standard and becomes a matter of reading a horrifying amount of standards documents and XML layers, which I'll save you the pain of doing by simply documenting the actual procedure here.

# UDS, ISO-TP, and CAN Background

Updates for this ECU, as for most modern control units, happen over UDS over ISO-TP over CAN, which is exposed on the standard OBD-II diagnostics port through a Gateway module. For the uninitiated, this is similar to layers in any other networking stack, from low to high:

* CAN (physical bus, device arbitration, addressing)
* ISO-TP (packet splitting/framing, checksums)
* UDS (application layer, request/response)

Thankfully, due to the highly standards-based nature of this system, constructing a flashing tool is relatively simple. The CAN and ISO-TP layers are outside the scope of this document, as they are handled for us by SocketCAN and CAN-ISOTP Linux kernel modules or the J2534 interface standard. This leaves us with responsiblity for UDS, for which a [wealth of extremely high quality open-source implementations are available](https://github.com/pylessard/python-udsoncan).

# Simos18 UDS Update Process

The basic update layout for Simos18 is block based, rather than address based as in some previous ECUs. Each block is indexed beginning from "customer bootloader" above - so 

1. CBOOT - actually written over the top of Calibration, as CBOOT_temp, and promoted into the CBOOT position if valid.
2. ASW1
3. ASW2
4. ASW3
5. Calibration

[The procedure to flash blocks looks like this](https://github.com/bri3d/VW_Flash/blob/master/lib/flash_uds.py):

* Clear Diagnostic Trouble Codes over OBD-II byte `04`, prior to upgrading to UDS. This is an essential "knock" which starts the diagnostic process in the Application Software.
* Enter UDS "extended diagnostic" session.
* Read a specific sub-set of UDS "local identifiers" corresponding to information the flashing tool needs to save off to the manufacturer, which also functions as a "knock" to signal the presence of a factory tool. 
* Invoke a "remote routine" on the ECU to verify programming preconditions and set some flags.
* Enter UDS "programming" session, which checks the preconditions above and if the correct flags are set, "descends" into CBOOT by loading a section of CBOOT into memory, halts the Application Software tasks, and passes execution off to CBOOT itself.
* Perform UDS Seed/Key Security Access. [Seed/Key Security Access on VW relies on a clever bytecode virtual machine](https://github.com/bri3d/sa2_seed_key). ODX update files are shipped with a small bytecode script, which the flashing tool runs against the Seed to create a Key.
* Write a "workshop log" to a specific "LocalIdentifier." This contains flash log information around the date, time, and workshop code. This data is eventually stored in the protected NVRAM container which also stores immobilizer, VIN, and trouble code data.
* Invoke a standard "remote routine" on the ECU to perform an Erase Block procedure, which will erase an _entire_ block, including its "OK flag."
* Send UDS "RequestDownload" with the block and length being downloaded, along with a "data format specifier" indicating "encryption A" and "compression A". The "Encryption A" and "Compression A" algorithms are ECU-series specific. That is, Encryption A is not always the same algorithm across all VW ECUs. The Simos18 versions of Encryption A (fixed-key AES-CBC) and Compression A (LZSS) are documented below.
* Repeat UDS "TransferData" with the encrypted and compressed block data. Remember, this ECU has nowhere near enough RAM to store a full block, and nowhere near enough free flash to store a second OS. So the data is immediately decrypted, decompressed, and written directly into flash in the area it will be executed from. 
* Send UDS Exit Transfer to signify the transfer is complete.
* Send a standard "remote routine" request to the ECU to perform a Checksum procedure on the block which was just written. The CBOOT checks a CRC32 checksum and an RSA signature. At this point, the "OK Flag" is written and the software is valid. If the checksumming process fails, the "OK Flag" is simply never written, and execution will not be passed off from CBOOT to the Application Software. If the block being checksummed is CBOOT, the ECU will actually restart back through SBOOT at this point to promote the newly-written "CBOOT_temp" into the CBOOT space.
* Repeat the "Block Transfer" routine for any additional blocks. Blocks may be flashed free-form as long as the Erase -> RequestDownload -> TransferData -> ExitTransfer process is followed - there is no requirement to write an entire software update at once, and the only ordering constraint is that erasing CBOOT also erases CAL due to the use of the CBOOT_temp area.
* Perform another "remote routine" to signify that Programming is complete. This will also check the version headers in each block, and write a final "coherence identifier" to Flash if all blocks are Valid and the version headers match. 
* Reboot the ECU and clear codes again to present a clean working state to the customer. If each block's Valid state as well as the coherence identifier, CBOOT will now jump into the newly installed Application Software.

# Compression and Encryption

VW Simos ECU data is uploaded using UDS data format identifier "AA," which signifies "Encryption A" and "Compression A."

`Encryption A` turns out to be "Audi AES" - AES128 with a fixed key and IV stored in the customer bootloader area. We can locate the key and IV by reverse-engineering the "TransferData" handler in the CBOOT block, which configures the AES128 state machine to accept data. Once we reverse-engineer this handler, we find that it always calls a function in the One-Time Programmed "tune protection area," at 0x80014088, which can be described as "AES_Set_Key_IV" . Once we know this function exists, identifying the Key/IV for a new series of ECUs becomes fairly easy as the export interface for the tuning protection block doesn't seem to change from version to version.

`Compression A` turns out to be [LZSS](https://github.com/bri3d/VW_Flash/blob/master/lib/lzss/lzss.c#L69)

# CBOOT Exploit

At this point we know how to flash factory software that passes the Checksum procedure. However, our goal is still to flash software that doesn't pass the Checksum procedure. We can send invalid, unsigned data to the ECU, and it will be written (remember, there's not enough storage or RAM to verify it before it's on the flash), but the Okay flag won't be written, so the Customer Bootloader will never jump into the modified software.

Unless...

*So, here it is.* The exploit that allows arbitrary code execution on Simos18. It's... ... ... can send an Erase command for one block, and then just write data to another block that's already been Checksummed and marked as Okay. That's it. That's the exploit. To make this even more humorous, several Tricore-based VW ECUs seem to share this basic exploit concept: overwriting a block that is not the one that was just erased.

It seems that when VW's engineers implemented the CBOOT flashing mechanism to send to the supplier, they followed a specification for a state machine where "Erase" was required before "Download" and "Checksum." This made sense, and would prevent arbitrary code execution as Erase would clear the Okay flag for a given block - except, they didn't check in their state machine _which_ block was Erased. Furthermore, they seem to have left support in the CBOOT for writing uncompressed data, which can be used to write over the top of un-erased flash.

Well, that was easy enough. The bad news is there's a little bit more to this...

At this point we're now trying to transfer data into a block of flash memory that hasn't been erased. We have no control over the flashing routine, which assumes the block has been zeroed and isn't telling the flash controller to erase a page. This is fraught with peril - as we can only flip bits upwards, not downwards.

The good news is that several nuances of Tricore come back to help us here: nop is 00, and there's empty space in the flash, so we have a lot of room to play with when it comes to writing a payload.

However, transferring data into already-written flash using this uncompressed data handler is a bit... wonky. We need to write our data very slowly to ensure the bits we want flipped actually physically end up flipped. We need to do so on a 256-byte "Assembly Page" boundary - because there isn't proper retry logic in the uncompresed write handler, and if one Assembly Page fails to write, an entire transfer block will be written incorrectly. We also need to write data we actually want persisted in 8-byte (64-bit) increments, and we can only reliably do so over empty space (00) due to the flash memory's error code protection (ECC). Every 8-byte block is given an ECC checksum, and the checksum is subject to the same issues as the data (can only flip up). So, if we want to overwrite existing non-zero data, we need to calculate an ECC collision which only flips ECC bytes upwards as well - otherwise, we will break the ECC for a section of Flash.

Thankfully, it turns out we don't actually need to calculate an ECC collision due to a handy collection of 8-byte `nop` sleds which can be safely overwritten with instructions.

So, we progress through the block, writing 256 bytes of '00' data repeatedly and ignoring the often-returned error status, until we reach an area we want to patch. Then we slowly write 8 bytes at a time, again stuffing the same block repeatedly until we can achieve a successful write status.

Problematic, but a workable solution for arbitrary code execution. Find some nops, replace them with a jump to empty memory, write a little procedure, flash it slowly and off we go...

# Exploit Payload

So, we have an arbitrary code execution primitive - what can we do with this access?

Can we just patch CBOOT and force it to mark every block as Okay? Not so fast. Remember how CBOOT writes each block directly to flash, verifies each block, and writes an Okay flag? That's not how CBOOT writes itself. If CBOOT overwrote itself directly in flash, bricking an ECU would become really easy - a partial write of CBOOT would spell doom! 

But, it turns out CBOOT is small! So, CBOOT updates CBOOT by writing the new CBOOT_temp to the second internal PMEM module (overwriting part of the Calibration), then applying the Checksum and Signature (RSA) process. If the CBOOT_temp area is valid, SBOOT will "promote" the CBOOT payload back over the "real" CBOOT, but only if it passed verification first.

And how does CBOOT overwrite PMEM, if it's running out of PMEM? Well, remember from the "programming" section earlier - it's not! CBOOT is loaded into memory to perform all of this flashing - rather than running out of PFLASH. This comes in handy for us shortly.

So, we can't patch CBOOT directly. We can Transfer CBOOT data without Erasing it, in the same way we can application data, but we're Erasing and Transferring into the "temporary" CBOOT, which gets checksummed and signature-checked before it's written back. Unless we can make this CBOOT valid, it will never get copied back into its "home" and will never execute. So that's not very useful, unless we want to chase an RSA exploit around for a bit.

But, we do have unconstrained code execution in ASW at this point, as we can overwrite whatever part of THAT we'd like (constrained to the standard block boundaries, of course). So let's explore our options:

* Small brain: Implement a flash procedure in our ASW code which can update a block for us and mark it as Okay.  We have to write a whole flasher in our ASW code, and there are a lot of gymanastics we need to do to turn off write protection, set up the right permissions, and access the flash controller. But this will work, eventually. Wasn't it nice having CBOOT do that for us before?
* Expanding brain: Patch the real CBOOT in flash directly from our ASW code. We still need to write a flasher, which sucks, but we only need to run it once in order to install a compromised CBOOT. We'll need to find a patch in the CBOOT that will cause it to write unauthenticated data (it turns out this is one instruction, which won't surprise those of us familiar with bypassing most authentication systems). But, this seems viable. Unfortunately it's also extremely high risk, because to tamper with existing data without erasing it requires an ECC collision, and a flawed ECC collision is a rapid path to a brick.
* Galaxy brain: Let CBOOT patch itself! Remember, ASW loads CBOOT into RAM when it "descends" into Programming mode. What if we just copy the "descent" code, patch the CBOOT in RAM before we jump into it, and if we're really lucky, what if the same authentication bypass will cause CBOOT to copy our own CBOOT back over itself? Could we be so lucky? ... of course we could, it's Simos18!
